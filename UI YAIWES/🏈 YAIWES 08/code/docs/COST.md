# Cost and token accounting

How REDCELL measures what a run spends, and why the number is what it is.

## Providers report tokens, not dollars

Native LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and so on) return token usage - `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens` - not a dollar amount. The cost is computed from those tokens and a per-model price.

The exception is OpenRouter, which can return the actual charge in `usage.cost` when the request asks for it. REDCELL uses that real number when available.

## How cost is resolved

For each LLM call, cost is resolved in order:

1. **OpenRouter real cost** - for the `openrouter` provider, the request sets `usage.include`, and the response's `usage.cost` is the charge.
2. **LiteLLM price map** - `litellm.completion_cost` multiplies the returned tokens by LiteLLM's own prices for models it knows.
3. **REDCELL price table** - a fallback in `engine/pricing.py` for models LiteLLM does not price (the catalog uses forward-looking model names LiteLLM has no entry for).

If none apply (an unknown model on a direct provider), cost is 0 rather than a wrong guess.

## Why spend used to read \$0.00

The model catalog uses names like `glm-5.3`, `claude-opus-5`, and `deepseek-v4-pro`. LiteLLM has no prices for them, so `completion_cost` returned 0 and the run never accumulated any cost. The price-table fallback fixes this.

## Per-run accumulation

Each metered call adds its tokens and cost onto the run via `runs.set_meters`. The run's `tokens` and `cost_usd` grow as the engagement proceeds.

The console header shows the running totals next to Elapsed and Model.

## The price table

`engine/pricing.py` maps a model to `(input, output)` in USD per 1M tokens. Cost is `prompt/1e6 * input + completion/1e6 * output`.

Lookup is by the last path segment, lowercased, so `z-ai/glm-5.2` and `glm-5.2` resolve the same.

An unknown variant falls back to its family (for example an unlisted `glm-5.x` uses a listed GLM price), so a new model still gets a sensible estimate.

Local providers (Ollama) cost nothing, so their estimate is 0 regardless of model.

## Updating prices

Edit `PRICES` in `engine/pricing.py`. Keep entries as USD per 1M tokens `(input, output)`. Prefer real published prices where a model exists.

For OpenRouter you usually do not need a table entry, since the real cost comes back on the response.

## OpenRouter details

The client adds `extra_body={"usage": {"include": true}}` for the `openrouter` provider so the response includes accounting.

It then reads `usage.cost` (USD). This reflects OpenRouter's actual charge, including any per-model routing and discounts.

## Accuracy and caveats

For non-OpenRouter providers the number is an estimate. It is only as accurate as the price table and the usage the provider reports.

Prompt caching, batch discounts, and provider promotions are not modeled in the table, so estimated cost can run high or low.

If a provider omits usage, tokens and cost for that call are 0.

## Budgets

A run can carry a `budget_tokens` ceiling. Track spend against it to stop a run before it runs away.

## Verifying

Start a live run and watch the header: tokens and dollars should climb as calls complete.

On OpenRouter, compare the shown cost against your OpenRouter dashboard for the same period; they should track closely.

## FAQ

**Why is it an estimate?** Because most providers do not return a dollar figure; REDCELL multiplies reported tokens by a price. OpenRouter is the exception and returns a real charge.

**The cost looks off.** Check the price-table entry for the model, and remember caching and discounts are not modeled.

**Still \$0.00 on a live run.** The provider may not be returning usage, the model may be unknown on a direct provider, or no LLM calls have completed yet.

**Local models show \$0.00.** Expected - self-hosted models have no API cost.

## Tokens explained

**Prompt (input) tokens** are everything sent to the model: system prompt, prior turns, tool definitions, and the current message.

**Completion (output) tokens** are what the model generates, including tool-call arguments.

**Total** is prompt plus completion. When a provider omits the total, REDCELL derives it from the two parts.

Output tokens usually cost more than input, which is why the table prices them separately.

## How a call is metered

1. The client calls the provider and receives the message plus a usage block.
2. It parses total, prompt, and completion tokens from usage.
3. It resolves cost (OpenRouter real, then LiteLLM, then table).
4. The runner books tokens and cost onto the run with `set_meters`.
5. The header reflects the new totals on the next update.

## Controlling cost

- Pick a cheaper model for routine work; reserve flagship models for hard steps.

- Set a token budget on the run so it stops before overspending.

- Keep scope tight; fewer targets and turns means fewer tokens.

- OpenRouter gives you real per-call cost, which makes tuning spend easier.

## Glossary

- **per 1M tokens** - prices are quoted per one million tokens; divide token counts by 1,000,000 before multiplying.

- **usage** - the accounting block a provider returns alongside the message.

- **metered call** - an LLM call whose tokens and cost are booked onto the run.

## Note

Cost is informational. Treat it as a close estimate for budgeting, not an invoice, except where OpenRouter reports the real charge.
