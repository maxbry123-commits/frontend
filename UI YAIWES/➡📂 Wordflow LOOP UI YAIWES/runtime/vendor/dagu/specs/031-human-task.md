# Spec: Human Tasks

## Status

Implemented.

## Scope

This spec defines:

- the `action: human.task` step shape
- the root-DAG-only execution boundary
- prompt resolution
- integration with the shared scalar-input schema
- generated step outputs
- the `waiting` checkpoint
- the local completion command
- atomic completion, idempotency, and resume
- local and distributed root-run behavior
- dry-run and error behavior

This spec does not define:

- `approval` behavior
- scheduler algorithms, queue protocols, or worker negotiation
- REST, Web UI, MCP, notification, authentication, or authorization behavior
- nested form objects or arrays

## Goal

A root workflow can stop at a processless step, accept an acknowledgement or a
small typed object, and continue the same DAG run later. Waiting must not keep
an executor process or distributed worker slot occupied.

Declared form values become ordinary step outputs under
`${steps.<id>.outputs.<property>}`. The completion command identifies the task
by that explicit step `id`.

## Terms

A human-task step has action exactly `human.task`.

The owning run is the DAG run containing the step.

A root DAG run has no parent DAG run. A child DAG run is invoked through
`dag.run`, `dag.enqueue`, or `parallel`.

An open human task is a human-task step in node status `waiting` that has not
accepted completion input.

Canonical input is the validated completion object after string coercion and
defaults. It determines idempotency and generated output values.

A waiting checkpoint is a finalized root-run state with overall status
`waiting` and no ordinary node still ready or running.

Resume continues the same logical root run under the same DAG-run ID while
preserving completed nodes and outputs.

## Behavior

### Step Shape

Minimal acknowledgement-only task:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: acknowledge
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm that maintenance has started
```

Fields owned by this spec:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | Yes | Must be `human.task`. |
| `id` | Yes | Step identity used for completion and output references. |
| `with.prompt` | Yes | Instructions for the operator. |
| `with.form` | No | Flat typed input object. Omit for acknowledgement only. |

Rules:

- The step must define an explicit `id` accepted by Spec 009.
- `name` does not satisfy the explicit `id` requirement.
- `with` must be an object containing only `prompt` and optional `form`.
- `with.prompt` must be a string containing a non-whitespace character before
  runtime value resolution.
- `with.form: null` is invalid. Acknowledgement-only tasks omit `form`.
- A human task starts no command, executor, container, or child DAG.
- `name`, `description`, `depends`, `working_dir`, `env`, `preconditions`, and
  `continue_on` retain their owning behavior.
- Defaults for `env`, `preconditions`, and `continue_on` apply.
- Process-oriented defaults do not add retry, repeat, timeout, notification,
  or signal behavior to a human task.

The following authored fields are invalid even when set to an empty or false
value:

- execution: `run`, `type`, `exec`, `command`, `script`, `call`, `config`,
  `llm`, `messages`, `params`, `routes`, and `value`
- shell: `shell`, `shell_args`, and `shell_packages`
- placement: `container` and step-level `worker_selector`
- lifecycle: `retry_policy`, `repeat_policy`, `timeout_sec`, and
  `signal_on_stop`
- iteration: `foreach` and `parallel`
- approval: `approval`
- output and logging: `stdout`, `stderr`, `log_output`, `output`,
  `output_schema`, and authored `outputs`
- failure notification: `mail_on_error`

### Human Tasks Are Not Approval Steps

`human.task` is a standalone step that waits without first executing a
process. `approval` is attached to another executable step and is outside this
spec.

A human task supports one completion result: validated input makes the step
`succeeded`.

### Root DAG Boundary

Rules:

- A human-task step can execute only in a root DAG run.
- A root DAG containing human tasks can execute locally or on a distributed
  worker.
- Human tasks do not add an implicit local worker selector.
- DAG-level worker selection continues to apply.
- A child DAG containing a human task fails before the child starts or creates
  child-run state.
- The child rejection applies to `dag.run`, `dag.enqueue`, and `parallel`.
- A human task is invalid inside `foreach.steps` or any `handler_on` handler.

A DAG definition containing human tasks is valid when executed directly as a
root. Its possible use by another DAG does not make static validation fail.

For multi-document YAML, static validation accepts a later named document that
contains a human task. Invoking that document as a child fails at runtime.

### Preconditions And Prompt

Rules:

- Step preconditions run before the task opens according to Spec 023.
- If preconditions are not met, the step becomes `skipped` and accepts no
  completion.
- A precondition evaluation error follows Spec 023 failure behavior.
- `with.prompt` is value-resolved after dependencies and preconditions allow
  the step to start.
- Prompt resolution uses parameters, constants, environment values, built-in
  context, and dependency outputs defined by Specs 003, 006, and 007.
- The resolved prompt is fixed for that open task.
- Changing the DAG file or process environment after the task opens does not
  change the prompt observed by status or resume.
- A prompt-resolution error fails the step without opening it.
- Form schemas and their metadata are literal and are not value-resolved.

### Form Integration

When present, `with.form` is a flat object schema:

| Root field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Yes | Must be `object`. |
| `title` | No | String display metadata. |
| `description` | No | String help metadata. |
| `properties` | No | Map of scalar field schemas using the same shape as schema-backed DAG parameters. Defaults to `{}`. |
| `required` | No | List of unique declared property names. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `additionalProperties` | No | Whether undeclared input is accepted. Defaults to `false`. |

Rules:

- A root field not listed in the table is invalid.
- Property names must match `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`.
- Every `required` name must be declared in `properties`.
- Declared properties use the same scalar field shape, validation, and
  string-coercion behavior as schema-backed DAG parameters. Supported property
  types are `string`, `integer`, `number`, and `boolean`; supported fields are
  `type`, `title`, `description`, `default`, `enum`, `oneOf`, `minimum`,
  `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, and `pattern`.
- Nested declared objects and arrays are invalid.
- Defaults and declared values are validated by the shared parameter-field
  rules.
- Defaults are applied before this form enforces `required`.
- An omitted optional property without a default remains absent.
- `additionalProperties: false` rejects every undeclared input property.
- `additionalProperties: true` retains undeclared properties in canonical
  input without creating step outputs for them.
- Through `--input`, an accepted undeclared value is a string.
- Through `--inputs-json`, an accepted undeclared value retains any valid JSON
  shape, including `null`, objects, and arrays.

### Generated Step Outputs

Rules:

- Every declared form property creates an output declaration with the same
  name.
- Authors must not declare `outputs` on a human-task step.
- A declared `string` property creates a `string` output.
- A declared `integer`, `number`, or `boolean` property creates a `json`
  output.
- A property publishes a value only when canonical input contains it.
- Undeclared properties never become outputs.
- Output values come directly from canonical input. Human tasks do not use
  stdout or `DAGU_OUTPUT_FILE`.
- A consumer uses `${steps.<human-task-id>.outputs.<property>}` and must depend
  directly or transitively on the human-task step.
- Completed outputs remain available after resume.

String outputs expose their string contents. Other scalar outputs expose their
JSON scalar text. Human-task publication is an explicit exception to Spec
012's file-producer behavior.

Canonical input and the generated-output object must each fit within the
owning DAG's `max_output_size`. A size error occurs before completion changes
the task.

### Opening A Waiting Checkpoint

When the step becomes ready, Dagu:

1. evaluates preconditions
2. resolves the prompt
3. changes the step to `waiting`
4. continues independent ready or running branches
5. finalizes the root run as `waiting` after no ordinary node remains ready or
   running
6. releases the execution process or distributed worker slot

Rules:

- Dependencies of the open task do not start.
- Several independent human tasks can be `waiting` in one checkpoint.
- A foreground local run that reaches a waiting checkpoint exits successfully.
- A distributed attempt that reaches a waiting checkpoint releases its worker
  capacity before the checkpoint is actionable.
- Once `dagu status` reports the waiting checkpoint, a valid completion command
  must not fail because the prior attempt is still finalizing.
- An open task has no step timeout or automatic expiration.

### Waiting Status Observation

The black-box status surface is:

```sh
dagu status --run-id <run-id> <root-dag-name>
```

For a waiting checkpoint, the command exits zero with empty stderr. Stdout must
identify:

- overall status `Waiting`
- each waiting human task's explicit step ID
- each task's resolved prompt
- each task's normalized form as JSON when a form exists

The displayed normalized form must:

- contain root `type`, `properties`, and explicit `additionalProperties`
- preserve authored root metadata and `required` names
- preserve supported scalar metadata and constraints
- contain each property's resolved scalar type

Omitted `properties` is displayed as `{}`. Other omitted optional fields can
remain omitted. Exact object-member order is not significant.

### Completion Command

The only completion operation in this spec is:

```sh
dagu human-task complete [flags] <root-dag-name>
```

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | Yes | Owning root DAG-run ID. |
| `--step` | Yes | Explicit human-task step ID. |
| `--input key=value` | No | One string input; repeat for multiple properties. |
| `--inputs-json object` | No | One typed JSON input object. |

Rules:

- The DAG name and run ID must identify one stored root run.
- `--step` is trimmed and matches the explicit step `id`, never `name` or a
  generated task identifier.
- The command runs only in a local CLI context with direct run-store access.
- The owning root run itself can have executed locally or remotely.
- `--input` and `--inputs-json` are mutually exclusive.
- Omitting both supplies `{}`.
- Completion uses the DAG snapshot and form belonging to the run. It does not
  reload the current DAG file.
- No reconciliation command is required before or after completion.

### `--input` Parsing

Rules:

- Each occurrence must contain `=`.
- The property name is the trimmed text before the first `=` and must not be
  empty.
- The value is every character after the first `=`; additional `=` characters
  are preserved.
- A property name cannot occur more than once.
- Declared values use the same string coercion as schema-backed DAG parameters.
- Accepted undeclared values remain strings.

### `--inputs-json` Parsing

Rules:

- The flag must contain exactly one non-null JSON object followed only by JSON
  whitespace.
- Object member names must be unique at every nesting level.
- Declared values keep their JSON type and do not undergo string coercion.
- JSON string `"3"` does not satisfy an `integer` property.
- Accepted undeclared values retain their complete JSON value.

### Canonical Input

Canonical input contains:

- supplied declared properties after applicable coercion
- defaults for omitted declared properties
- accepted undeclared properties

It excludes omitted optional properties without defaults.

Canonical equality ignores object-member order and insignificant JSON
whitespace. It compares the resulting JSON values after defaults and coercion.
Reordered `--input` flags and reordered JSON object members therefore produce
the same canonical input.

### Completion Results

Successful completion writes exactly one of these lines to stdout and writes
nothing to stderr:

| Condition | Stdout |
| --- | --- |
| New completion; another node remains waiting | `Completed human task <step>; DAG-run remains waiting.` |
| New completion; resume accepted | `Completed human task <step>; DAG-run queued for resume.` |
| New completion; a concurrent request already queued resume | `Completed human task <step>; DAG-run was already queued for resume.` |
| Identical repeat; no resume is needed | `Human task <step> was already completed.` |
| Identical repeat; the run still needs resume | `Human task <step> was already completed; DAG-run queued for resume.` |

Each line ends with one newline. Success exits zero.

A failed completion exits non-zero, writes no stdout, and writes a diagnostic
to stderr without command usage text.

### Atomicity And Persistence

A successful new completion atomically makes these observable changes:

- the selected node changes from `waiting` to `succeeded`
- canonical input becomes the immutable completion value
- generated outputs become available
- unrelated nodes remain unchanged

No observer can see only a subset of those changes. Input validation and size
checks occur before any change.

Completion state must survive the completion process exiting. The persistence
format and run-store file layout are outside this spec.

When completion identifies the stored run by its root DAG name and run ID,
changing or deleting the source DAG after the checkpoint does not change form
validation, defaults, outputs, or resume behavior for that run.

### Idempotency And Concurrency

Rules:

- Repeating completion with the same canonical input exits zero.
- An identical repeat does not change completion input or outputs.
- Repeating completion with different canonical input fails with a conflict.
- Two concurrent commands with the same canonical input both exit zero and
  converge on one completion.
- Two concurrent commands with different canonical input produce exactly one
  successful completion. The other command fails with a different-input
  conflict.
- Downstream steps execute at most once because of duplicate or concurrent
  completion commands.
- An identical repeat after the run leaves `waiting` never starts another
  resume.

### Resume And Multiple Waiting Nodes

After completion:

- If any node remains `waiting`, the run remains `waiting` and no resume is
  requested by that completion.
- If no node remains `waiting`, Dagu requests resume automatically.
- Resume keeps the same DAG-run ID and uses the stored DAG snapshot.
- Completed nodes, including human-task outputs, remain completed.
- Downstream nodes become eligible according to their dependencies.
- A later sequential human task can create another checkpoint in the same
  logical run.

Completion is durable before resume is requested. If synchronous resume
preparation or queueing fails:

- completion remains successful and is not rolled back
- the task is not reopened
- the command exits non-zero and states that completion was stored but resume
  failed
- repeating the same completion retries resume without rewriting completion
  state

Only one successful resume can result from those retries.

After queueing succeeds, dispatch, launch, and execution follow the same
asynchronous behavior as any other queued DAG-run.

### Distributed Root Runs

Rules:

- A distributed worker persists the waiting checkpoint and releases the
  attempt before completion becomes actionable.
- Completion uses the local CLI against the shared run store; it does not
  reconnect to the worker that opened the task.
- Resume keeps the same DAG-run ID and the root run's worker-selection rules.
- Resume is not forced to a local worker.
- A different selected worker can execute the resumed attempt.
- Generated outputs remain available when resume occurs on another worker.

Coordinator RPC shape, queue representation, and worker capability negotiation
remain outside this spec.

### Dry Run

Rules:

- Dry run evaluates preconditions and resolves the prompt.
- A successful dry-run human task becomes `succeeded` without entering
  `waiting`.
- Dry run does not accept completion input or publish form outputs, including
  defaults.
- Dry run starts no executor process for the human task.

## Errors

### Validation Errors

Validation must fail without executing a step when:

- the step shape violates Step Shape
- `form` is null or is not an object
- the form root has an unsupported field or a type other than `object`
- `properties` is not an object
- a property name is invalid
- a property violates the shared scalar parameter-field rules
- `required` is not a unique list of declared property names
- `additionalProperties` is not a boolean
- a human task appears in `foreach.steps` or a handler

The diagnostic must identify the invalid field path or unsupported step field.
Validation must not value-resolve the prompt or form.

### Runtime Opening Errors

The step fails without opening when prompt resolution fails or a precondition
evaluation fails. A child-DAG invocation fails before creating child-run state
and identifies that human tasks are not permitted in child DAGs.

### Completion Error Diagnostics

Completion diagnostics must contain the listed information:

| Failure class | Required diagnostic content |
| --- | --- |
| Remote CLI context | `human-task complete` and `local context` |
| Missing required flag | the missing flag name |
| Run store unavailable | `DAG-run store` |
| Missing run | requested DAG name and run ID |
| Unreadable run snapshot | `DAG` or `status`, plus the read failure |
| Invalid or missing step | requested step ID and `human task` |
| Run not waiting | run ID and `not waiting` |
| Invalid flag combination | `--input` and `--inputs-json` |
| Invalid `key=value` syntax | `--input` and `key=value` |
| Duplicate input property | property name and `duplicate` |
| Invalid JSON input | `--inputs-json` and `JSON` |
| Duplicate JSON member | member name and `duplicate` |
| Coercion or form validation | step ID, property name, and expected type or failed keyword |
| Acknowledgement input | step ID and `does not accept input` |
| Size limit | step ID and `maximum size` |
| Different prior input | step ID and `different input` |
| Concurrent run mutation | step ID and `changed` |
| Resume queueing failure after completion | step ID, `completed`, and `could not be queued for resume` |

The task and downstream steps remain unchanged for every failure before atomic
completion.

### Abort, Timeout, And Cleanup

- A human task has no executor process to signal or clean up.
- Step retry, repeat, timeout, and signal fields are invalid.
- An open task does not expire automatically.
- A terminal or non-waiting run rejects a new completion.
- Concurrent terminal-state and completion operations cannot partially
  overwrite each other.
- General run abort and deletion behavior is outside this spec.

## Examples

### Acknowledgement And Resume

```yaml
steps:
  - id: maintenance_started
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm that maintenance has started

  - id: continue_maintenance
    depends: maintenance_started
    run: printf 'continued\n' > continued.txt
```

With run ID `spec031-ack`, status must expose the waiting step and completion is:

```sh
dagu human-task complete \
  --run-id spec031-ack \
  --step maintenance_started \
  acknowledgement
```

The command requests resume and `continued.txt` eventually contains
`continued\n`.

### Typed Form And Outputs

```yaml
steps:
  - id: release_review
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Choose the release target
      form:
        type: object
        properties:
          environment:
            type: string
            enum: [staging, production]
          replicas:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            default: 2
          notify:
            type: boolean
            default: true
        required: [environment]

  - id: record_release
    depends: release_review
    env:
      TARGET: ${steps.release_review.outputs.environment}
      REPLICAS: ${steps.release_review.outputs.replicas}
      NOTIFY: ${steps.release_review.outputs.notify}
    run: printf '%s,%s,%s\n' "$TARGET" "$REPLICAS" "$NOTIFY" > release.txt
```

```sh
dagu human-task complete \
  --run-id spec031-form \
  --step release_review \
  --input environment=production \
  typed-form
```

Canonical input is
`{"environment":"production","notify":true,"replicas":2}` and the resumed
step writes `production,2,true\n`.

### Multiple Waiting Tasks

```yaml
steps:
  - id: review_a
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm A

  - id: review_b
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Confirm B

  - id: deploy
    depends: [review_a, review_b]
    run: printf 'deployed\n' > deployed.txt
```

Completing `review_a` leaves the run waiting and does not create
`deployed.txt`. Completing `review_b` requests one resume and creates the file
once.

### Stored Form Snapshot

Start a run from a fixture whose required property is `environment`. After the
checkpoint, replace the source DAG with a second static fixture whose required
property is `region`. Completion with `environment` must still succeed and
publish the original output.

### Child DAG Rejection

```yaml
steps:
  - id: run_child
    action: dag.run
    with:
      dag: child

---
name: child
steps:
  - id: review
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Review child work
```

Static validation succeeds. Running `run_child` fails before child-run state is
created.

### Dry Run

```yaml
steps:
  - id: review
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Review ${env.TARGET}
      form:
        type: object
        properties:
          approved_for:
            type: string
            default: dry-run
```

With `TARGET=staging`, dry run resolves the prompt and succeeds without waiting
or publishing `approved_for`.
