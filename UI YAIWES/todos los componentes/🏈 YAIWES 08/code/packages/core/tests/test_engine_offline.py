"""Offline test of the live engine: the real plan/act loop, executor, SimBackend,
repositories, and bus wired together, with a scripted fake LLM instead of litellm.
Covers delegation, command execution, finding recording, the operator ask/answer
round-trip, and that everything gets persisted and published."""
