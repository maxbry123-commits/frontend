# Command palette and shortcuts

The command palette is the fastest way to move around the console and jump straight to a session, server, or proxy.

## Opening it

Press Cmd+K (macOS) or Ctrl+K (Windows and Linux) from anywhere in the console.

Press Escape or click outside to close it.

## What it searches

- **Pages** - Overview, Sessions, Findings, Reports, Servers, Proxies, Settings.
- **Actions** - New session, and other quick actions.
- **Sessions** - by name, client, or a target in scope.
- **Servers** - by name or host.
- **Proxies** - by label or url.

## Results are grouped

Matches are grouped under Actions, Pages, Sessions, Servers, and Proxies, each with its own header, so a long list stays readable.

## Keyboard navigation

- Arrow Down / Arrow Up move the selection, wrapping at the ends.
- Enter opens the highlighted result.
- Escape closes the palette without navigating.
- Hovering a result highlights it, so mouse and keyboard stay in sync.

## How matching works

Typing filters by a case-insensitive match across each item's label, secondary text, and keywords (a session's client and targets, a server's host, a proxy's url).

With an empty query the palette shows just the pages and actions, so it opens fast and uncluttered.

Results are capped so a very large workspace does not render a huge list at once. Narrow the query to find a specific item.

## Examples

- Type part of a session name or its client to jump into that session's console.

- Type a target domain or IP to find the session that has it in scope.

- Type a server's hostname to open that server.

- Type part of a proxy url to open that proxy.

- Type a page name (for example "settings") to go there.

## Icons

Each result carries an icon for its kind: a grid for Overview, a target for a session, a rack for servers, a relay for proxies, a gear for Settings, and so on. The icons are distinct so you can scan by shape.

## Extending the palette

The palette lives in `apps/web/src/app/CommandPalette.tsx`.

- To add a page, append an entry to the `PAGES` list with a route and an icon.

- To add an action, append to the `ACTIONS` list.

- To add an entity source, read a list hook and map its rows into items with a `group`, a `to` route, an icon, and `keywords` for search.

- To add an icon, add a case to the `Icon` component. Icons are stroked, so use simple outline shapes.

## Performance

The entity lists come from cached queries, so opening the palette does not fire new requests in the common case.

Filtering is a plain in-memory pass, and the result cap keeps rendering cheap.

## Why not findings and reports

Findings and reports are scoped to a session, so a global search would fan out a query per session. The palette searches sessions instead; open a session to reach its findings and reports.

## Design notes

The palette previously listed only static pages, and some icons were generic. This made it a page switcher rather than a way to find things.

Searching real entities turns it into a jump-to-anything tool, which is what a command palette is for.

## Keyboard reference

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Cmd/Ctrl + K | Open the palette |
| Type | Filter results |
| Arrow Down | Next result |
| Arrow Up | Previous result |
| Enter | Open the selection |
| Escape | Close the palette |

## Pages at a glance

- **Overview** - KPIs, activity, and recent sessions.
- **Sessions** - the list of engagements; open one for its console.
- **Findings** - triage across findings.
- **Reports** - generate and download engagement reports.
- **Servers** - execution servers and their health.
- **Proxies** - egress proxies and their health.
- **Settings** - provider keys, models, execution, and branding.

## Accessibility

The palette is a labelled dialog. Focus moves to the search input on open.

Everything is reachable by keyboard; no result requires the mouse.

## What each search returns

- A **session** result opens `/sessions/<id>`, the operator console for that engagement.
- A **server** result opens `/servers/<id>`, that server's detail page.
- A **proxy** result opens `/proxies/<id>`, that proxy's detail page.

## Tips

- Searching a client name lists all that client's sessions.

- Add more of the name to narrow a long list quickly.

- The fastest path to a session is Cmd/Ctrl+K, a few letters, Enter.

- With no query, the palette is a quick page switcher.

## FAQ

**Why do I only see pages at first?** With an empty query the palette shows pages and actions. Start typing to search sessions, servers, and proxies.

**A session I expect is missing.** Check the spelling, and note that only loaded sessions are searchable; refresh if the list is stale.

**Can I search findings?** Not globally yet, because findings are per session. Open the session and use its Findings panel.

**Can I add my own commands?** Yes; see Extending the palette above.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing matches.** The query matches label, secondary text, and keywords. Try a shorter or different term.

**Results look stale.** The lists come from cached queries; navigate to the relevant page once to refresh the cache.

**Typing does nothing.** The input takes focus on open; click it if focus was lost, then type.

## Notes

Selection wraps: pressing Arrow Up on the first result jumps to the last, and Arrow Down on the last jumps to the first.

The first result is selected as you type, so Enter opens the best match without any arrow keys.

The query resets each time the palette opens, so you always start from a clean search.

Search is case-insensitive; capitalization never matters.

Keep the palette in muscle memory: it is almost always faster than clicking.
