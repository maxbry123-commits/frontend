# Pre-authentication surface

What an unauthenticated client can observe from a REDCELL deployment, and the project's stance on each. REDCELL is offensive tooling, so the login boundary is a real target.

## Principles

- Reveal as little as possible before authentication. Nothing that helps an attacker fingerprint or target the instance.
- No version or build identifier is shown before login. Knowing the exact version lets an attacker match it to known issues.
- No credentials or credential hints are shown on a production login page.
- No internal topology (bind addresses, internal hostnames, ports) is described in the UI.
- Authentication errors are generic and do not distinguish unknown user from wrong password.

## Reachable without authentication

- **The login page** (`/`, static assets). Serves the console shell; the app data behind it requires a session cookie.
- **`GET /api/v1/auth/first-run`** reports whether the instance is on its default admin password so the UI can prompt a change. It does not return the password itself.
- **`POST /api/v1/auth/login`** accepts credentials and sets a session cookie. Rate limited.
- **`GET /api/v1/health`** returns a liveness signal for orchestration. It carries no version or build detail.
- Every other API route requires a valid session; unauthenticated calls return 401.

## What the login page shows

The login page shows only the product name and the sign-in form. It does not show a version string.

It does not claim a bind address. Where the console binds is a deployment detail, not something to advertise on the login screen.

In development, when the admin password is still the default, a hint block explains how to change it. Set real `REDCELL_ADMIN_*` values (or let the deploy generate them) so no hint is shown in production.

## HTTP headers

Responses should not carry a version or framework banner. Avoid `X-Powered-By` and a descriptive `Server` header on public responses.

Behind a reverse proxy you can strip or rewrite server-identifying headers at the edge as a second layer.

## Authentication errors

A failed login returns a generic message. The UI shows "Invalid credentials." for both an unknown username and a wrong password, so the response does not confirm which usernames exist.

Avoid leaking account existence through response timing where practical.

## Rate limiting

`POST /auth/login` is rate limited to slow credential stuffing and brute force. The draft-chat endpoint is rate limited too.

Add IP-based rate limiting or a WAF at the proxy for defense in depth.

## Session cookies

The session cookie is HttpOnly so page scripts cannot read it.

Over HTTPS the cookie is marked Secure (`REDCELL_COOKIE_SECURE=true`), so it is never sent over plain HTTP.

The cookie uses a SameSite policy to limit cross-site submission.

## Transport

Serve the console over HTTPS in any real deployment. Plain HTTP exposes credentials and the session cookie in transit.

The deploy supports automatic HTTPS for a direct domain and a proxy mode for a fronting CDN. See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

## Operator recommendations

- Put the console behind a VPN or an identity-aware proxy if only your team needs it. The strongest pre-auth surface is one the public cannot reach at all.

- If a CDN fronts the origin, restrict the origin to the CDN's source ranges so nobody hits it directly.

- Change the default admin password immediately, or set `REDCELL_ADMIN_*` before first boot so there is never a default.

- Use strong, unique `REDCELL_JWT_SECRET` and `REDCELL_SECRET_KEY`. The deploy generates these per instance.

- Monitor failed logins and unusual access patterns. Alert on spikes.

- Keep the deployment current so fixes land quickly.

- Expose only ports 80 and 443. Keep Postgres, Redis, and MinIO on the internal network.

## Verifying

Load the login page and confirm no version string appears in the page or its assets.

Check response headers do not advertise a version:

```bash
curl -sI https://your-domain/ | grep -iE 'server|x-powered-by' || echo "no banner"
```

Confirm protected routes reject anonymous access:

```bash
curl -so /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://your-domain/api/v1/sessions
```

Confirm a bad login returns a generic error and does not reveal whether the username exists.

## This change

Issue #63 removed two pre-auth disclosures from the login page.

- The stale `v0.1` version string is gone. No version is shown before authentication.

- The `Console binds to 127.0.0.1` notice is gone. It was inaccurate behind a proxy and described internal topology.

- A regression test (`AuthGate.test.tsx`) asserts the login page contains no version pattern and no bind address.

## Related surfaces to keep clean

- Static asset names and comments should not embed a version.

- Production bundles should not ship source maps that reveal internal structure.

- Interactive API docs should not be world-readable in production if they reveal internal routes.

- Stack traces must never reach the client; return generic errors.

## Pre-auth review checklist

- [ ] No version or build string anywhere before login.
- [ ] No version banner in response headers.
- [ ] No credentials or hints on a production login page.
- [ ] No bind addresses or internal hostnames in the UI.
- [ ] Login errors are generic.
- [ ] Login is rate limited.
- [ ] Served over HTTPS with a Secure session cookie.
- [ ] All data routes return 401 without a session.

## Why version disclosure matters

A version string lets an attacker fingerprint the exact build and look up issues fixed after it, turning a blind probe into a targeted one.

Mass scanners key off banners and version strings. Removing them keeps the instance out of automated target lists.

Operators still need the version. Expose it only after authentication (Settings), never on the login page.

## FAQ

**Where can I see the version now?** After signing in. A future change exposes it in Settings for authenticated operators.

**Why did the login page show credentials?** Only in dev, when the admin password is still the default. Set `REDCELL_ADMIN_*` for production and the hint disappears.

**Did the console really bind to 127.0.0.1?** In some local setups, but not behind the deploy's reverse proxy. The static notice was misleading, so it was removed.

**Is it safe to expose the login publicly?** Safer with these measures, but a VPN or identity-aware proxy in front is stronger. Treat public exposure as a deliberate choice.

## Threat model notes

The anonymous attacker sees only the login page, the first-run flag, the health check, and generic login errors. That is the intended surface.

A network attacker without TLS could read credentials in transit; HTTPS closes this. Enforce it.

A brute-force attacker is slowed by rate limiting and generic errors, and should be stopped by a strong admin password.

## Browser hardening headers

- `X-Frame-Options` / `frame-ancestors` to prevent the login page being framed for clickjacking.

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` so responses are not MIME-sniffed.

- A strict `Referrer-Policy` so navigations away from the console do not leak the URL.

- `Strict-Transport-Security` once HTTPS is confirmed working, to pin future visits to HTTPS.

## Logging

Log authentication events (success and failure) with source IP so brute force and credential stuffing are visible.

Never log passwords, tokens, or session cookies.

## Session lifetime

Sessions expire, so a leaked cookie does not grant indefinite access. Sign out on shared machines.

## If you suspect compromise

Rotate `REDCELL_JWT_SECRET` (invalidates existing sessions) and `REDCELL_SECRET_KEY`, and change the admin password.

Review recent logins, sessions, and any runs that were started, then restore from a known-good backup if needed.
