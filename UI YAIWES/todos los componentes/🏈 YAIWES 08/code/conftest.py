"""Test isolation for the whole suite.

The suite runs against REAL infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, MinIO) rather than
mocks. Those must NEVER be the same instances the dev app uses: some tests are
destructive (test_seed calls seed.unseed(), which DELETEs every row and empties
every bucket). To keep the dev data safe, this conftest rebinds all shared infra
to throwaway, test-only resources *before* the app's db/storage singletons touch
them:

  - Postgres : a separate `<db>_test` database (created here if missing)
  - Redis    : logical DB index 15 (the app uses 0)
  - MinIO    : `test-*` buckets (the app uses uploads/loot/reports/public)
  - Checkpts : disabled (SQLite checkpoint store off during tests)

The redirection happens at import time, ahead of importing redcell_core.db, so
the async engine binds to the test database from the start.
